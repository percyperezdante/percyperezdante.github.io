# Main topics:

- Creating an account
- Examining traditional data center challenges:

    - Large up-front investment
    - Difficult to predict future traffic or demand
    - Slow deploy of new data centers and servers
    - Maintain data centers is expensive
    - You own all security and compliance burden with all data centers


- Benefits of cloud computing

    - Trade capital expense for variable expenses: you pay what you use
    - Scaling
    - Stop to guess future needed capacity, traffic
    - Speed and agility
    - Stop spend money for maintenance
    - Go global in minutes. Deploy new data centers in any part of the world
    - Elasticity
    - Realibility: failover,
    - Agility: 
        - Low cost of trying new business ideas
        - Reduces time to maintain infrastructure
        - Reduces risk for orgs aroud security and compliance
        - Provides access to emerging techs



- What is cloud computing:

> It is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pat-as-you-go pricing.

- Types of clouds
    - Iaas you can full/maximun control of your infra
    - SaaS you provide a software as a service, you do not worry about infra
    - PaaS: Provide a plataform where you put your code and run it.

- Cloud deployment models:
    - Public cloud: such as AWS(pay as you go), GCP
    - On-Premises: Private cloud in a private data center
    - Hybrid: Use public and on-prem clouds

# AWS Global infrastrucute

Three types of infra:

## Regions
- It is a specific gographic region
- Each region has a CLUSTER of data center
- AWS has 22 launched regions

## Availability Zones

- It is one or more data centers
- One region has Multiple avalability zones
- Minimun: one reqion has minimun two availability zones
- Each availability zone has at least ONE data center
- Therefore, one region has at least two data centers
- Each availability zone is located within the geographical area of the AWS region
- Availability zones have redundant power, netowrking, and connectivity.
- Globaly, there are 69 availability zones

 What is availability:

> Extent to whcih an application is fulfiling its intended business purpose. Applications that are highly-available are built in a manner where a single failure wont lessen the application's ability to be fully operational


The first one is availability base on business needs. The second case is 100% availability, high availability


#### Naming syntax

For example: us-east-2b
Where:
    - us = area
    - east = sub-area
    - 2 = Nubmer that identifies the region in that area
    - b = availabitlity zone

From here:
    - the REGION NAME = us-east-2
    - The availability zone = us-east-2b

## Edge locations

- Part of a global content delivery network CDN
- These support only TWO services:
    - Amazon CLoudFront: which is AWS CDN
    - Amazon Route 53: which is AWS DNS service
    - There are more than 200 different location with edge locations
    - It is the most predominant and common infra in AWS
    - Edge locations server content from location that are closer to users
