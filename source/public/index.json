Wawa, from the Aymara Baby, is a project inspired in how to help a mum to keep one eye in her newborn baby while she is executing some activity inside the house, in particular in the case when the newborn baby is sleeping and you want to monitor your baby. Qilquiri Qilquiri, from the Aymara Writer, is a helper that generates snipes of common Java-base code from a Vim session. For example, create a class signature by just presing two keys. Achacachi Achachachi is the name of a small town located on the Altiplano in the South American Andes. This project is a small set of scripts to re-deploy my laptop configuration. When my laptop broken or simply needs to be re-installed, \u0026#34;I need to back to Achacachi\u0026#34; to get all the configuration back as before. "

	"content": "Reproducibility The idea to promote reproducibility was inspired by my last research work, nMANET. At many points of my research, I was stopped by many issues, which were required help from experts. Helpers need to reproduce the issue locally, which not always is a trivial task. However, if there is a method to let the helper reproduce the issue in a fast and painless manner, the discusion of the problem became more predominant compared with the effort of reproduce the problem. I am planning to fill this page with more details during my free time, which is the reason of why I tag this site as under construction. "

To achieve this, I am designing, implementing and testing JNFD, which is the prototype of nMANET, and that is functional in Andriod and Linux base mobile devices. The source code of JNFD is open source and it has been tested in smartphones such as MotoE, MotoG, and Samsumg Note4, and also in laptops and through JNFD simulators such as Mini-JNFD.\nActivities   Sports. I like to play football and basketball, but also I often swim. I currenly swiming for the Diabetes UK charity, swim22. We formed a great team of colleges who are willing to swim approximatelly 230 Km all together. As a team we would love to have your contributions if possible of course.\n  Devops days Edinburgh 2020. I am member of the organizers for the 2020 Devops days in Edinburgh. Devops days happen here in Edinburhg once a year and is an international conference that include technical talks about software development, IT infrastructure operations, and a mix of them.\n  Notes This section contains a set of basic tutorials I wrote for my students. They are simple notes I took from books and online resources. These notes are grouped in the following categories.\n  Minimal infrastructure\n  Software Development\n  Infrastrucuture as a code\n  Devops \u0026amp; SRE\n  "

	"content": "Very brief overview NDN for MANETs approach, represented as nMANET, aims to offer an alternative perspective on how the characteristics of NDN can be utilised to solve the limitations of MANETs. nMANET has its roots in Named Data Network NDN, an instance of Content Centric Networks CCN. In contrast with traditional TCP/IP networks, CCN enables content addressing instead of host based communication, and secures the content instead of securing the communication channel between hosts. Therefore the content can be obtained from the intermediate caches or final information producers.\nThough NDN has proven to be an effective design in wired networks, it does not perfectly fit in Mobile Adhoc Networks. This is due to the high mobility of mobile devices and their resource constrains such as remaining energy in batteries. nMANET intends to fill this gap by developing a prototype called JNFD and Mini-JNFD.\nMore details about the project will be released in the last trimester of 2020\n"
