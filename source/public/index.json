Wawa, from the Aymara Baby, is a project inspired in how to help a mum to keep one eye in her newborn baby while she is executing some activity inside the house, in particular in the case when the newborn baby is sleeping and you want to monitor your baby. Qilquiri Qilquiri, from the Aymara Writer, is a helper that generates snipes of common Java-base code from a Vim session. For example, create a class signature by just presing two keys. Achacachi Achachachi is the name of a small town located on the Altiplano in the South American Andes. This project is a small set of scripts to re-deploy my laptop configuration. When my laptop broken or simply needs to be re-installed, \u0026#34;I need to back to Achacachi\u0026#34; to get all the configuration back as before. "

At many points of my research, I was stopped by many issues, which were required help from experts. Helpers need to reproduce the issue locally, which not always is a trivial task. However, if there is a method to let the helper reproduce the issue in a fast and painless manner, the discusion of the problem became more predominant compared with the effort of reproduce the problem. I am planning to fill this page with more details during my free time, which is the reason of why I tag this site as under construction. "

A zone is a single failure domain witdh in a region. - Region: Group of zone, independen geographical areas.  The basics To work in GCP you organise your work load in projects. These projects organize GCP resorues with common basic objectives.

To achieve this, I am designing, implementing and testing JNFD, which is the prototype of nMANET, and that is functional in Andriod and Linux base mobile devices. The source code of JNFD is open source and it has been tested in smartphones such as MotoE, MotoG, and Samsumg Note4, and also in laptops and through JNFD simulators such as Mini-JNFD.\nActivities   Sports.

	"content": "Introduction to SRE How does SRE differ from Devops? Devops and SRE point to similar goals, which is break down organizational barriers to deliver software features faster.\nTraditionally, developers are responsable for features and operations for stability. Developers want to move faster to release new features and operations want to move slow to keep all service stable. As a commong results, tension between teams appears during realease times. Devops and SRE practices aim to break downs this tensions.\nIn general, Devops approach include the following areas:\n- Reduce organizational silos: --\u0026gt; Break down tension promotes collaboration between teams. - Accept failure as normal - Implement gradual change: --\u0026gt; Small and incremental changes are easy to review and maintain. - Leverage tooling and automation - Measure as much as you can On the other side, SRE appraoch to same areas are as following:\n- Reduce organizational silos: --\u0026gt; Operation responsability to release in production is shared with developers. - Accept failure as normal: --\u0026gt; Blameless postmordem. Failure is expected and it is hold by an error budget. - Implement gradual change: --\u0026gt; Small and incremental release, such as Canary releases. - Leverage tooling and automation: --\u0026gt; Measure toil and automate to minimise manual intervention. - Measure as much as you can: --\u0026gt; Measure toil, reliability and service. Therefore, one initial conclusion is that:\n SRE is a concrete class that implements Devops\n What is CRE? It stands for Customer Reliability Engineering and it is focus on breaking down organizational barries between service prodivers and customers. In this context, failure is pre-accepted as a conditions to enhance future cases, error budget.This pre-condition helps to minimise panic when a down time happens at the service level. Another important criteria is to implement measurements that can offer to everyone, in both sides, visibility of on how the service performs.\nHow can they help you be more reliable? In various cases, customers use provider\u0026rsquo;s services, through APIs. in different ways that are not expected by the service provider, and providers do not like to breaks the customer expectation. This sceneario is easly visible the number of customers scale up.\nCRE helps to providers to openinly communicate with customers. Clear communication of how your service was designed to behave, indirectly means to expose provider\u0026rsquo;s SRE practices, such is their SLOs, to the customers. By teaching or helping the customers to build their own SRE environment, we are teaching them how to interact correctly with our system or platform. Consequently, the real scope and limitations are presented clearly to the customer, which formilise what the customer can expect as a final result.\nIn conclusion, by sharing SRE practices with customers, not only new features can be released faster, it also enhance customer satisfactione.\nWhy Are SLOs Important for Your Organization?

	"content": "Very brief overview NDN for MANETs approach, represented as nMANET, aims to offer an alternative perspective on how the characteristics of NDN can be utilised to solve the limitations of MANETs. nMANET has its roots in Named Data Network NDN, an instance of Content Centric Networks CCN. In contrast with traditional TCP/IP networks, CCN enables content addressing instead of host based communication, and secures the content instead of securing the communication channel between hosts. Therefore the content can be obtained from the intermediate caches or final information producers.\nThough NDN has proven to be an effective design in wired networks, it does not perfectly fit in Mobile Adhoc Networks. This is due to the high mobility of mobile devices and their resource constrains such as remaining energy in batteries. nMANET intends to fill this gap by developing a prototype called JNFD and Mini-JNFD.\nMore details about the project will be released in the last trimester of 2020\n"
