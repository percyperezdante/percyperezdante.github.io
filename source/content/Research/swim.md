## Objective  and evaluation metrics
I am planning to go back to swim and this time I have 60 minutes to practice swim as best as I can. The main objectives for this initial stage are:

1. List the steps to execute in order to ensure leave my main door of my place and back to the same door within 60 minutes.
2. Reach a swim speed of 1500 meters / 30 minutes = 50 meters per minute free style. This is because my shoulder requires recovering.
3. Analyze whether the list of steps can be standarized in my dailly life.

## Steps to ensure 60 minutes 

This is an iterative process and as it is expected, the initial results only set the start point or pilot scenario. Each section requires to be detailed as specific as possible to show what actions were executed during that period. These sub-parts required are part of the data collection, as they are going to help to list the steps required to have an optimized procedure.

I divided the whole process in parts

#### PART I; Go to pool
1. **home-readerIn**: Time spend from my door to swimming pool card reader.
2. **readerIn-room**: Time spend from after passing the card reader until the changing room
3. **room-pool**: Time spend from the changing room to the entrance of the pool

#### PART II: Swim
4. **Laps**:  Number of laps during 30 minutes

#### PART III: Go back home
5. **pool-room**: Time spend from entrance pool until chaging-room
6. **room-shower-room**: Time spend to have a shower and back to the changing room
7. **room-readerOut**: Time spend form changing room to the exit card reader machines
8. **readerOut-home**: Time spend from the exit card reaader in the pool to main door home
