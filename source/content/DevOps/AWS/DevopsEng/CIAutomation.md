# II Designinh a Source control strategy with CodeCommit

- Devops covers at least the following areas:
    - Development workflows
    - Test, build, and deploy applications
    - Infrastructure as a code

- Why AWS
    - AWS is public cloud leader
    - AWS is a full platform of integration with other services.

- What is Devops
    > It is a blanket term for tooling, practices, and ideas that allow organization sto build better software - faster. It includes:
    - Source control systems
    - Agile software technologies
    - Infrastructure as a code
    - Automated testing
    - Automated deployment

- What is CI/CD
    - CI= Continuous integraation. This includes:
        - Commit your code to SCM
        - Build your code
        - Run tests
    - Continuous Delivery includes all stages in CI plus the followings:
        - Deploy to QA for testing
        - Request manual approval 
        - Deploy to Production
    - Continouos Deployment includes all stages mentioned before, except the "request for manaul approval "

- Version control systems, VCS
    - Distributed VCS:
        - Mercurial
        - Git
    - Centralised VCS
        - SVN
        - CVS
        - Perforce

- Git flow
    - Complicated
    - Great for maintain multiple versions of software
    - Popular before web
    - Github flow is well suited to web development: Vincent Driessen

- Github flow
    - Popular for web development
    - Encourage best practices with frequent smaller merges
    - Well suited for CI/CD practices.

- Benefits of CodeCommit-
    - You do not maintain the infra hosting your code
    - user and team management
    - Permission management
    - Integration with CI/CD tooling and testing workflows
    - Allow you code review and pull request approval workflow 

- Working with AWS CodeCommit

    - Using admin account create a CodeCommit repo
    - Add IAM user with specific permissions

    - Users can generate credentials  and used them to get CodeCommit repo 

- How to use CodeCommit
    - Open the CodeCommit console
    - Click Create repository
    - Type repository name
    - Click Create, this will create a repo using the root account. WE need to create IAM

    - Go to the IAM console
    - Creat new user by clicking "Users", left side
    - Type name of the user, select Programatic access and AWS management console access, click next
    - Add permissions to this user:
        - You can create  a group, click create group
        - Enter group name, for example : developers
        - Select policy:
            - You can select "poweruseraccess "policy if you do not know what to choose.
            - Also you can select "codecommit power user" policy
            - Click create group
        - Now that we have created a group, click it and it will add the user to this group
        - You can add tags if you need group users.
        - Click create user

        NOTE: **Once you click create, you will have ONLY ONE CHANGE TO copy**
            - Secret access key
            - Password
            - Access key ID
            - Sigin link 

            **----> Copy them to a safe place**

- First push to CodeCommit

    - Open the Signin as IAM user page
    - Enter you account ID, IAM user name, and password
    - Go then to the CodeCommit console 

    We need to create an SSH key for the repository we will work on:
        - Click on the repository
        - Click on SSH
        - From you local directory, generate a pair of SSH keys.
        - Upload the PUBLIC key in the AIM access manager 
            - Open AIM console
            - CLick on users, and find your user
            - Click en security credentials
            - CLick on "upload ssh key public"
            - Copy the SSH KEY ID

        - Add an entry in your `.ssh/config` file with the following

                Host git-codecomit.*.amazonaws.com
                User YOUR AIM SSH KEY ID 
                Identify ~/.ssh/id_rsa <-- private key

        Note:
            - .ssh/config permission should be 600
            - Now you can clone from your local as:

            $ git clone ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.clm/v1/repos/test

# III Infrastrcuture as a code
- Benefits:
    - Not expensive, cost management
        - You can allocate cost for all resources. For example by tagging the resource
        - You can have stimated costs for each stack
        - Helps you to avoid leftover resources
        - Offers policy compliance
        - Less redundant work 

    - Reproducible
        - No UI to make mistakes in
        - No series of commands to run correctly
        - Use one config file and deploy 
        - Parametrize across different regions or stages
        - 
    - Secure
        - Templates can be reviewed by other developers
        - Create approved reusable templates
        - Limit the way of changing infra
        - Audits can focus on IaC changs and app logs

- AWS cloud formation
    - What is?
        - AWS service to manage infra as a code
        - Uses Json or Yaml syntax
        - Allows extend through AWS Lambda 
        - Controls the state of your infra by describing every single cloud resource in code
    
    - Basic concepts
        - Templates: Information about the resources to create
        - Stacks: List of AWS resources to create using templates
        - AWS Resources

    - Tools 
        - AWS CDK
        - AWS SAM
        - Â£rd party frameworks

    - AWS cloud development kit
        - Controling your infra using high-level or low-level constructs that consist of one or more cloud resources.

    - AWS serverless application model: LAMBDA
        - Developing and deploying AWS lambda based applications 

    - AWS code deploy
        - Deploying application code to different cpmpute services with nuanced rollout strategies.

    - Permissions
        - Need to set permission to work with CloudFormation
        - Also permissions for all the services touched by CLoudFormation

    - Security for CloudFormation with CI/CD
        - Build pipelines using CLoudFormation carry lots of permissions
        - Have isolated and inaccessile build environments if possible
        - Sexure the pipeline and how to modify it or its permissions
        - Secure the git workflows that trigger build pipelines


- Deploying CloudFormation
    - Open the CloudFormation console
    - CLick "Create Stack", wiht "new resources"
    - Click on "create template in Designer"  <= you also can click on "Template is ready"
    - Click on "template" bar, and there you can write your infra as a code in json format
    - Once you copy your code in the template section, click "refresh" ( right top botton)
    - Validate the template by clicking on the check mark on the top of the panel
    - CLick upload
    - CLick Next -> type a name for the stack -> click "next"
    - CLick Next -> Click "create"

    Now that the resource were created, to verify them:

    - Click on "resources"
    - Also you can see events, once all events are completed:
        - Go to the selected resource console, for example SNS
        - Look for the topic, click in topics. You should be able to find your topic there.

    Here an example of how looks like a template:

![cloud formation tempalte](/devops/aws/devopseng/cloudformationtemplatejson.png?width=10pc)

- Deploying CloudFormatoin from CLI

    ```bash
    # To deploy a stack 
    $ aws cloudformation deploy \
            --template-file myTemplate-stack.json \
            --stack-name    demoStack

    # To delete a stack
    $ aws cloudformation delete-stack \
            --stack-name  demoStack
    ```

- Parameter store in Lambda functions

    ```bash
    # To create a parameter
    $ aws ssm put-parameter \
        --name  MyParameter1 \
        --value Hello \
        --type  SecureString    <== this means encrypted

    # To get the value of a parameter with an encrypted value
    $ aws ssm get-parameter \
        --name MyParameter1 \


    # To get the value of a parameter with an decrypted value
    $ aws ssm get-parameter \
        --name MyParameter1 \
        --with-decryption 

    # TO update the value of the paramter
    $ aws ssm put-parameter \
        --name  MyParameter1 \
        --value HiHi \
        --type  SecureString \ 
        --overwrite

    ```
- Deploying parameters in Lambda function
    ```bash
    # Create a stack with AIM capabilities
    $ aws cloudformation deploy \
            --template-file myTemplate-stack.json \
            --stack-name    demoStack
            --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  <= allows you to use roles 

    # To list Lambda functions
    $ aws lambda list-functions

    ```
    If the last command is too long, alternative way to find a specific  is:
        - Open the Lambda console
        - Order the deployed lambda functions by "last modified". Copy the name fo the lambda function

        ```bash
        #  To retrieve the value of the lambda function
        $ aws lambda invoke \
            --function-name XXXXASFASXZXXXXXX \ <-- name of the function copy from the lambda console
            result.txt                          <--  Will save output in a file
        ```
