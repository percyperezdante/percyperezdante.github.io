The following pages contain notes that I took from courses online. These notes are in here as way to summaries my understanding and record them as personal notes.

#### * **Site Reliability Engineering: Measuring and Managing Reliability** by Google Cloud  SRE-MMR

This course is divided in four weeks.

- [**Week 1**](sre-mmr-week1/):
    - Introduction to SRE
    - Targeting Reliability
    - Operating for Reliability
- [**Week 2**](sre-mmr-week2/)
- [**Week 3**](sre-mmr-week3/)
- [**Week 4**](sre-mmr-week4/)


#### * **[SRE CON 2019 Dublin](srecon2019/)**
Notes about some of the talks at [SRE Dublin 2019](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea)

[The SRE I Aspire to be by Yaniv Aknin at SRECON 2019](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/presentation/aknin)**

- Yaniv A. is GCP quantitative reliability lead.
- SRE skill is the ability to measure or translate to numbers ( quantify ) 
- SRE includes: "measurably optimse reliability vs cost"
- It is important to trade Operations and Reliability
- How can we build a more reliable logical disk? then we do not need to increase operations due to failure. One solution as use RAIDs, but cost more and more complexity!
- SRE is trading cost and reliability
- Remove alerts, reduce operations
- Fundamental: Monitoring, Alerting, Capacity planning, CI/CD & rollouts, and Load Balancing.
- Advanced: System Architecture, Distributed Algorithms, Networking, Operating systems.
- Pioneering: Product management, data science, business Acumen, UX research.
- Measurements are tied to the project priorities and operations are tied to these measurements.
