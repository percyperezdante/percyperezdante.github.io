# Welcome

My name is Percy, and this site has a minimal content about my interests, activities, and notes I recorded for myself or for people with similar interests.

#### Interests

My main interests include to develop, experiment and test new technologies related to:

* nMANET
* Reproducibility
* Teaching
* Automation 
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
* Site Reliability Engineering
* DevOps
* Software Development Enginering
* Cloud computing
* Distributed systems
* Security  

##### NOTE: 

nMANET is an approach that intends to offer an alternative to solve the limitations of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks in emergency scenarios such as earthquakes and social riots. 

nMANET intends to show whether future Internet architectures such as Name Data based Networking protocol can be applied in Mobila Ad-hoc networks. To achieve this, I am designing, implementing and testing JNFD, which is the prototype of nMANET, and that is functional in Andriod and Linux base mobile devices. The source code of JNFD is open source and it has been tested in smartphones such as MotoE, MotoG, and Samsumg Note4, and also in laptops and through JNFD simulators such as Mini-JNFD.

#### Activities

* **Sports.** I like to play football and basketball, but also I often swim. I currenly swiming for the Diabetes UK charity, [swim22](https://swim22.diabetes.org.uk). We formed a great team of colleges who are willing to swim approximatelly 230 Km all together. As a team we would love to have your [contributions](https://swim22.diabetes.org.uk/pages/wacky-whales) if possible of course.

* **Devops days Edinburgh 2020.** I am member of the organizers for the [2020 Devops days in Edinburgh](https://devopsdays.org/events/2020-edinburgh/contact/). Devops days happen here in Edinburhg once a year and is an international conference that include technical talks about software development, IT infrastructure operations, and a mix of them.


#### Notes

This section contains a set of basic tutorials I wrote for my students. They are simple notes I took from books and online resources. These notes are grouped in the following categories.

* Minimal infrastructure

* Software Development

* Infrastrucuture as a code

* Devops & SRE
