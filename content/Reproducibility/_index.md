# Reproducibility

#### The idea to promote reproducibility was inspired by my last research work, nMANET. At many points of my research, I was stopped by many issues, which were required help from experts. Helpers need to reproduce the issue locally, which not always is a trivial task. However, if there is a method to let the helper reproduce the issue in a fast and painless manner, the discusion of the problem became more predominant compared with the effort of reproduce the problem.

#### I am planning to fill this page with more details during my free time, which is the reason of why I tag this site as under construction.
